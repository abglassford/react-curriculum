## What are props and why are they important?

As you've seen, **props** are data that's passed into a `ReactElement` object when it's created. For example, you can use props to pass in HTML attributes when creating an HTML tag element.

```jsx
var element = <p className="bold">Tokyo Dog</p>;
```

You can also use props to pass in *immutable*, or unchangeable, data when creating a component class element. This data, which is accessible anywhere inside a component class via the `this.props` object, is used to configure a new component before it's mounted (i.e. inserted into the DOM). After a component's props are set, they never change.

```jsx
var Hello = React.createClass({
  render: function() {
    return <h1>{this.props.greeting} world</h1>;
  }
});

ReactDOM.render(
  <Hello greeting='Hello' />,
  document.getElementById('hello')
);
```

Every component has their own `this.props` object which is just a plain, old JavaScript object. But remember, the key-value pairs inside `this.props` are immutable. That means `this.props` is not a good location for storing data that's received *after* the component has been mounted. For that, you need to look elsewhere...

## What is state and why is it important?

**State** is *mutable*, or changeable, data that's initialized and updated from within a component class element. This data, which is accessible anywhere inside a component class via the `this.state` object, is initialized by the `getInitialState` function that, when present, is automatically invoked *once* before a component is mounted. A component's state is updated by event handlers that receive data from events like user input or server responses.

```jsx
var Hello = React.createClass({
  getInitialState: function() {
    return { who: 'world' };
  },

  handleChange: function(event) {
    var nextState = { who: event.target.value };
    this.setState(nextState);
  },

  render: function() {
    return <div>
      <h1>Hello {this.state.who}</h1>
      <input
        onChange={this.handleChange}
        type="text"
        value={this.state.who}
      />
    </div>;
  }
});

ReactDOM.render(
  <Hello />,
  document.getElementById('hello')
);
```

Every component has their own `this.state` object which is just a plain, old JavaScript object. And because the key-value pairs inside `this.state` are mutable, they're the perfect location for storing data that changes over time. However, always use the `this.setState` function to merge `nextState` into `this.state` because, after the merge, the component is automatically re-rendered.

## How are props and state used together?

When mounting a component, React uses one-way data binding to combine a component's props, state, and presentation logic into a user interface. It may help to think of the data inside of `this.props` and `this.state` as inputs for a component's `render` function.

```jsx
var Hello = React.createClass({
  getInitialState: function() {
    return { who: 'world' };
  },

  handleChange: function(event) {
    var nextState = { who: event.target.value };
    this.setState(nextState);
  },

  render: function() {
    var message;

    if (this.state.who.trim() === '') {
      message = this.props.greeting + '?';
    } else {
      message = this.props.greeting + ' ' + this.state.who;
    }

    return <div>
      <h1>{message}</h1>
      <input
        onChange={this.handleChange}
        type="text"
        value={this.state.who}
      />
    </div>;
  }
});

ReactDOM.render(
  <Hello greeting="Hello" />,
  document.getElementById('hello')
);
```

When a user inputs new data, the component updates its `this.state` object  using the `this.setState` function. The new `this.state` and the unchanged `this.props` are automatically recombined with the presentation logic of the `render` function and a new user interface is produced.

Remember, the `render` function is a pure function. In other words, it should return the same `ReactElement` given the same `this.props` and `this.state` objects. Keeping the `render` function pure makes components easier to reason about.

## How are props and state used separately?

In larger React applications, components tend to come in two flavors—those that are stateful and those that are stateless.

A **stateful component** may have props but it definitely has state. Typically, a single stateful component is the root component of a component hierarchy and manages the majority of the hierarchy's state. As the manager, they're responsible for updating the state due to events generated by a user or by a server. Even though you clearly can't do without state in an interactive app, you should avoid having too many stateful components.

A **stateless component** often has props but it definitely has *no* state. Typically, a stateless component receives it props from the root component in the component hierarchy and are responsible for the majority of presentation logic of user interface. Since state increases complexity and reduces predictability, stateless components are easier to think about. And because of that, there are more stateless components in a typical component hierarchy that stateful components.

```jsx
var Book = React.createClass({
  handleChange: function(event) {
    this.props.updateState(this.props.index, event.target.value);
  },

  render: function() {
    return <div>
      <h2>Book {this.props.index}: {this.props.book}</h2>
      <input
        onChange={this.handleChange}
        type="text"
        value={this.props.book}
      />
    </div>;
  }
});

var Books = React.createClass({
  getInitialState: function() {
    return {
      books: ['The Lord of the Rings', "Ender's Game"]
    }
  },

  updateState: function(index, value) {
    var nextBooks = this.state.books;
    nextBooks[index] = value;
    this.setState({ books: nextBooks });
  },

  render: function() {
    var bookEls = this.state.books.map(function(book, index) {
      return <Book
        book={book}
        index={index}
        key={index}
        updateState={this.updateState}
      />;
    }, this);

    return <div>{bookEls}</div>;
  }
});

ReactDOM.render(
  <Books />,
  document.getElementById('books')
);
```

**NOTE:** Instance of the `Books` are said to **own** instances of `Book` because, in React, an **owner** is the component that sets the props of other components.

#### A Warning

If we look in the chrome console we see the following warning:

"Warning: Each child in an array or iterator should have a unique "key" prop. Check the render method of BookList. See https://fb.me/react-warning-keys for more information."

Check out [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28329382/understanding-unique-keys-for-array-children-in-react-js) stackoverflow for why this is encouraged by React. How can we refactor our previous example to remove this warning?

Hint: We are using `map` to iterate over our array. The callback function to map takes in additional parameters including the index, can we use that as our unique key to remove the warning?
