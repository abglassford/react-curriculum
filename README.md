* Complete all of the assignments in the readme
* All of the assignments and examples are in the [examples](/examples) folder

### Keys for Success

* STAY CURIOUS! Keep googling and searching for answers, the React community is growing rapidly and there are already many excellent resources online to learn more about it.
* Feeling stuck? Do your best to google for the answer, and if you are unable to find a solution, post your questions on StackOverflow! If you are absolutely stuck, ask an instructor, but we will ask to see all the research you have done to solve the problem first!
